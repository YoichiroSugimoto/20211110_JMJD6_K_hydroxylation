# Introduction

This pipeline performs the analyses of LC-MS/MS data for "title of paper". Specifically, the pipeline performs the following analyses.

0. Data preprocessing
    - Biochemical and biophysical properties of proteins such as local charge and disorderedness are calculated here
1. Analysis of JMJD6 interactome data
    - Proteins co-immunoprecipitated with JMJD6 in the presence of DMOG are identified, and their characteristics are examined.
2. Analysis of JMJD6 hydroxylation sites and the stoichiometry
    - JMJD6 hydroxylation sites and the stoichiometry of the modification are analysed. In addition, the effect of JMJD6 for arginine dimethylation are also analysed.
3. Analysis of the characteristics of JMJD6 hydroxylation sites

# Directory structures

- **data** 
    - Input data for this pipeline are stored. These include the LC-MS/MS data processed by `Peaks` and the list of manually curated JMJD6 hydroxylation sites based on the inspection of the data.
- **R**
    - Scripts which process the LC-MS/MS data and extract biochemcial and biophysical properties of JMJD6 substrate proteins or sites are stored. All the scripts are written in `rmarkdown`.
- **results**
    - Key output files of the scripts are stored.
- **doc**
    - Output of `rmarkdown` scripts and the figures which are generated by the scripts are stored
